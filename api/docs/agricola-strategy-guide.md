# Agricola Strategy Guide: Game Foundations and Draft Thinking (4-Player)

## Part 1: What Wins Games

### The Scoring Landscape

A competitive 4p winning score typically lands between 45 and 65 points. That range is wide because it depends heavily on flip order, draft quality, and how efficiently players contest action spaces. But the scoring structure itself is fixed and worth internalizing:

**Board scoring (the baseline everyone fights for):**
- Fields: -1/1/2/3/4 for 0-1/2/3/4/5+
- Pastures: -1/1/2/3/4 for 0/1/2/3/4+
- Grain: -1/1/2/3/4 for 0/1-3/4-5/6-7/8+
- Vegetables: -1/1/2/3/4 for 0/1/2/3/4+
- Sheep: -1/1/2/3/4 for 0/1-3/4-5/6-7/8+
- Wild boar: -1/1/2/3/4 for 0/1-2/3-4/5-6/7+
- Cattle: -1/1/2/3/4 for 0/1/2-3/4-5/6+
- Unused farmyard spaces: -1 each
- Fenced stables: +1 each
- Clay rooms: +1 each / Stone rooms: +2 each
- Family members: +3 each (max 5 = 15 pts)
- Begging cards: -3 each

**Card scoring (the ceiling that separates winners from the pack):**
- VP printed on minor improvements (120 cards have VP values, ranging from -3 to +7)
- Bonus point effects on cards (conditional scoring based on farm state)
- Major improvements (Joinery, Pottery, Basketmaker's Workshop, etc.)

The critical insight: **the board baseline is a floor, not a ceiling.** Every player can theoretically max out every board category. The practical constraint is actions — you only get ~28 baseline placed actions (2 workers x 14 rounds), and you need those actions to cover food, resources, building, plowing, sowing, fencing, and growth. You can never do everything. The game is about choosing which things to do well and which to accept less than perfect on.

### The Action Economy

This is the single most important concept. Every round, each family member takes exactly one action. The game lasts 14 rounds. With 2 starting workers:

- **No growth:** 28 total actions
- **Grow once (round 5-7):** 35-37 total actions
- **Grow twice (rounds 5-7 + 12-13):** 37-39 total actions
- **Grow three times (aggressive):** 39-41 total actions (requires room for 5 family members)

Each additional family member who arrives in round N adds (14 - N) future actions. A child born in round 5 adds 9 actions. One born in round 12 adds 2. This is why **early growth is so valuable** — the earlier you grow, the more total actions you get across the game, and actions are what generate everything else.

But growth has a cost: each new family member needs 2 food per harvest (1 food in their birth harvest). And growth requires rooms, which require resources and an action to build. So the game's central tension is: **spend actions now to grow (investing in future actions) vs. spend actions now on food/farm/points (immediate value).**

The most powerful cards are the ones that give you the most value relative to their cost — both the explicit cost (resources for minor improvements, food to play occupations) and the implicit cost (what you have to do in your game to unlock the benefit). The best cards reward you for playing a solid game you'd want to play anyway — Lord of the Manor gives bonus points for having a full, well-developed farm. The worst force you into suboptimal lines to meet their conditions. When evaluating cards, always ask: "How much do I have to warp my game to make this work, and is the payoff worth it?"

### The Food Problem

Food is the game's primary constraint. At every harvest (after rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14), each family member costs 2 food. On top of that, playing occupations costs food (1 food per occ after the first on the main Lessons space), and some minor improvements have food costs too. A 3-person family across all 6 harvests needs roughly 30-34 food just for feeding — add occupation costs and the real total is higher.

The pressure isn't constant, though. **Early game, food is easy.** You start with 2-3 food, only have 2 family members, and the first harvest isn't until after round 4. You need fewer than 1 food per round to survive the first harvest. Through the round 7 harvest, food remains manageable. **Then the squeeze hits.** After growing your family, you need 6+ food per harvest, and harvests come every 2 rounds (rounds 9, 11, 13, 14). That's 3+ food per round, on top of everything else you need your workers doing. This is where underprepared players collapse.

Players who spend too many actions acquiring food fall behind on farm development. Players who solve food efficiently free up actions for scoring. But the draft's job isn't to solve food immediately — it's to establish a plan that will scale to meet the late-game pressure.

**Food efficiency spectrum:**
- **Terrible:** Taking Day Laborer for 2 food every round. ~1.0 food per action.
- **Okay:** Fishing accumulation (builds up food over rounds). Variable.
- **Good:** Baking bread with a Fireplace/Cooking Hearth (2-3 food per grain, grain comes from sowing which is already useful for scoring).
- **Great:** Animal breeding with cooking improvements (animals multiply, convert to food when needed, AND score points).
- **Exceptional:** Card-based food engines — Basket Carrier trades 2 food for wood + reed + grain at harvest; Milking Stool generates food from cattle you're already keeping for points.

The best food plans are ones where the food-generating actions also advance scoring. Sowing grain feeds you AND scores grain points. Breeding animals feeds you AND scores animal points. This dual-purpose efficiency is what separates strong players.

### The Three Pillars

Every winning game rests on three pillars, roughly in priority order:

**1. Food engine** — How you'll feed your family. Doesn't need to be solved early (the first few harvests are manageable), but must scale to handle the late-game crunch when harvests come every 2 rounds and you have 3-4 mouths. Best engines use the fewest dedicated actions and ideally generate points along the way (sowing grain for baking, breeding animals for cooking).

**2. Actions and growth** — How you'll generate enough actions and resources to build a competitive farm. The most common path is growing your family — more family members = more workers = more actions per round. But growth isn't the only way. Cards that generate resources passively, perform actions as side effects, or multiply the value of action spaces all serve the same purpose. The question isn't "how do I grow?" but "how will I get enough done?" Growth is usually part of the answer, but action-efficient cards can substitute for or complement growth.

**3. Point ceiling** — How you'll push past the baseline into winning territory. This comes from bonus point cards, major improvements, efficient farm coverage, and stone house upgrades. The theoretical max from farm scoring alone is roughly 55-60 points, but this is very rarely achieved — maxing all animal categories in particular is extremely hard. It's possible to win with a clean farm and relatively minimal bonus scoring, but having some card-based points gives you a meaningful edge.

### Farm Layout Thinking

The 3x5 farmyard (15 spaces) must be filled. Unused spaces cost -1 each. The starting position is 2 wood rooms in the bottom-left column. Everything else is a choice:

- **Rooms** take farmyard spaces but score points (clay: 1pt/room, stone: 2pt/room) and enable growth
- **Fields** take farmyard spaces, can be sown for grain/vegetable scoring, and provide food via baking
- **Pastures** (fenced areas) hold animals, score points per pasture (not per space), and enable breeding
- **Stables** double pasture capacity when fenced, score 1pt each when fenced, and hold 1 animal unfenced

Good players think about their target farm layout during the draft. The most common strong layout has 3-4 rooms, 4-5 fields, and fenced pasture spaces with stables. 5+ rooms is an outlier enabled by specific Big House strategies; 2 rooms is a Small House niche. Cards reshape what's optimal — animal-heavy drafts want more pasture space; sow-heavy drafts want more fields.

### Flip Order: The Uncontrollable Variable

Within each stage, the exact round a new action appears is random:
- Stage 1 (Rounds 1-4): Sow/Bake, Major/Minor Improvement, 1 Sheep, Fences
- Stage 2 (Rounds 5-7): 1 Stone, Renovation + Improvement, Family Growth + Minor Improvement
- Stage 3 (Rounds 8-9): 1 Vegetable, 1 Wild Boar
- Stage 4 (Rounds 10-11): 1 Stone (second), 1 Cattle
- Stage 5 (Rounds 12-13): Plow and/or Sow, Family Growth without room
- Stage 6 (Round 14): Renovation + Fences

The biggest swing: **When does Family Growth appear in Stage 2?** Round 5 growth gives the new family member 9 remaining rounds of actions. Round 7 growth gives only 7. This 2-action difference is significant.

Strategies that are less dependent on a specific flip order are inherently safer. Cards that reduce flip-order dependency (e.g., Trowel lets you renovate on your own schedule rather than waiting for the Renovation round card) are more valuable as hedges.

## Part 2: Draft Strategy

### The Draft Structure

In 4p, the draft works as follows:
- **Rounds 1-4:** You see a full hand of cards (10/9/8/7 for rounds 1-4), pick one, pass the rest. Occupations and minor improvements are drafted in separate simultaneous tracks.
- **Rounds 5-7:** Returning hands. You see the same hands again after they've circled the table, but cards taken by opponents are gone. You can infer what others prioritized.
- **You end with 7 occupations and 7 minor improvements.**

### Draft Phase Priorities

**Rounds 1-2: Anchor cards.** These are the picks that define your strategy. You want the single strongest card in each hand — prioritize raw power (PWR rating) and cards that solve food, enable growth, or provide exceptional action efficiency. Don't worry about synergy yet; just take the best card available. The top ~50 cards by rank are all first-pick worthy.

**Round 3: Strategic direction.** By now you have 2-3 strong cards. Start considering how they fit together. If you took Brewery Pond (Fishing) and Bookshelf (Lesson), lean into cards that synergize with fishing and occupation play. If you have Furnisher and Wooden Hut Extender, you're heading toward a big house strategy.

**Round 4: Fill the biggest gap.** What does your draft NOT have yet? If food is unsolved, prioritize food. If you have no growth plan, take a growth card. If you have food and growth but no point ceiling, take a scoring card.

**Rounds 5-7: Opportunistic.** The remaining cards are weaker. Take whatever best complements your existing picks. Watch for cards that dropped in rank but synergize perfectly with your specific strategy — the 200th-ranked card that fits your engine is better than the 100th-ranked card that doesn't.

### Reading the Draft

**What disappeared matters.** Between rounds, cards vanish from the hands. High-rank cards disappearing early is expected. But watch for patterns:
- Multiple Day Laborer-tagged cards disappearing? Someone's on that strategy — the Day Laborer action space will be contested.
- Animal cards being snapped up? Fencing and animal accumulation spaces will be fought over.
- Lesson/occupation-engine cards going? Someone is building an occupation-heavy engine.

This information helps you in two ways: (1) you can avoid fighting over the same contested action spaces, and (2) you can occasionally hate-draft a card that would complete an opponent's engine.

### Evaluating Individual Cards

The card database provides several useful metrics:

- **Rank (1-773):** Overall power ranking. Lower = better. The top ~100 cards are reliably strong.
- **PWR (0-5.31):** Raw power metric. Cards above 3.5 are excellent; above 4.0 are elite.
- **ADP (1.13-6.44):** Average Draft Position. Lower = drafted earlier. Shows how the community values the card. A low ADP card is one everyone wants; a high ADP card often wheels to later rounds.
- **Value (0-15.44):** Draft value combining multiple factors. Higher = better draft pick considering availability.
- **Play Rate:** How often the card is actually played when drafted. A 95% play rate means it almost always makes your final strategy. A 40% play rate means it's situational.
- **Elo per Play:** How much it improves your rating when played. High elo/play = the card meaningfully contributes to winning.

**The best picks combine high PWR with high play rate and high elo/play.** A card like Lover (Rank 1, 93% play rate, 5.2 elo/play) is nearly always correct to take. A card with high PWR but low play rate might be strong but situational — you need the right supporting cards.

**ADP vs. Rank divergence is interesting.** Forest Clearer is rank 10 but ADP 1.24 — it's drafted even earlier than its rank suggests. Field Watchman is rank 44 but ADP 1.13 — it's the *first* card drafted on average despite being rank 44, because it's an automatic pick in any grain-based strategy. When ADP is much lower than rank, the community values the card more than pure power suggests (likely due to flexibility or strategy-enabling properties).

### The Investment Model: Why Strategies Work

The core logic of card strategy in Agricola is **upfront investment to multiply the value of future actions.** Every strategy asks you to spend actions early (playing occupations, building improvements) so that later actions generate far more than they would on their own.

Consider Day Laborer. Without any supporting cards, the Day Laborer space gives 2 food — barely worth taking. But say you've played Assistant Tiller, Seasonal Worker, and Stew across your first few rounds. That's at least 3 actions invested in setup. Now a single Day Laborer action gives you 6 food, a field, and a grain or vegetable. That single action is worth 3-4 normal actions. The investment has paid off.

This investment model is what makes coherent draft strategies so much more powerful than collections of individually strong cards. **The payoff isn't additive — it's multiplicative.** Each new synergistic card doesn't just add its own effect; it amplifies the value of every other card in the engine.

### Two Ways Strategies Generate Advantage

All card strategies in Agricola generate advantage through one of two mechanisms (sometimes both):

#### Type 1: Making Lightly-Contested Spaces Valuable

Most action spaces in 4p are used on fewer than half of all rounds. Day Laborer, Grain Seeds, Traveling Players, Fishing, Farmland, Major/Minor Improvement — these spaces sit empty most rounds because their baseline value isn't worth a worker placement. Without a strategy built around it, Day Laborer might only be used once or twice across an entire 4-player game.

Card strategies change this calculation. When you've loaded up on Day Laborer cards, suddenly that space is worth a massive multi-action — and nobody else wants it. You're getting the equivalent of 3-4 actions from a space your opponents would never touch. Even better, because these spaces are lightly contested, you can often take them as your **last play of a round**, after seeing what opponents have done, and still get your full payoff.

This is the engine behind most tagged strategies: **Day Laborer, Grain, Sow, Traveling Players, Fishing, Major/Minor.** All of them transform an underused space into a high-value action. The investment is the cards you play to set it up; the return is an action space that's essentially uncontested and worth multiple normal actions.

The risk is that the strategy needs **critical mass** — a single Day Laborer card doesn't make the space worth visiting regularly. You need 2-3 synergistic cards to cross the threshold where the space becomes worth prioritizing in your round. If the draft doesn't give you enough supporting cards, the investment doesn't pay off.

#### Type 2: Getting More Actions

The other path to advantage is simply having more things happen per round than your opponents. This comes in two forms:

**Growth-enabling strategies** make it easier to add family members, which adds placed actions for every remaining round. Big House strategies (Furnisher, Wooden Hut Extender, Recreational Carpenter) build rooms cheaply and quickly, giving you room for children. Small House strategies (Field Doctor) skip room-building entirely and grow with 2 rooms. Either way, the advantage is compounding — an extra family member from round 6 onward adds 8 actions to your total game.

**Generated-action strategies** give you actions without requiring family growth. Stone House cards like Plow Driver plow a field every round once you're in stone — that's an action you never have to spend a worker on. Stable strategies like Sample Stable Maker generate resources through stable recycling. Lesson strategies like Stallwright give you free stables after occupation plays. These cards don't give you more workers, but they effectively give you more output per round by performing actions as side effects of other things you do.

The best strategies combine both types. A Big House engine that builds rooms cheaply (Type 2 — easier growth) and leverages Traveling Players to get free room-building actions (Type 1 — making an underused space valuable) attacks from both angles.

### Complementary Cards vs. Strategy-Defining Cards

Not every card needs a full strategy behind it. There's an important distinction between:

**Strategy-defining cards** require commitment. Day Laborer cards are only worth playing if you plan to use the Day Laborer space multiple times. Without that commitment, Excavator (Rank 161) is a wasted action — you played an occupation that gives you wood and clay on a space you rarely visit. The top DL cards like Assistant Tiller and Hardware Store are powerful enough to be worth taking in many contexts, but the deeper DL cards like Loam Pit or Stew are dead weight without the full engine.

**Complementary cards** enhance actions you were already going to take. Forest Clearer (Rank 10) makes wood accumulation spaces better — and every player takes wood regularly. Cultivator (Rank 28) gives you wood + food per field tile — and most players plow fields anyway. These cards don't require you to change your behavior; they just make your existing good actions better.

During the draft, this distinction matters:
- **Strategy-defining cards** are high-risk, high-reward. Take them when you're building toward a specific engine.
- **Complementary cards** are reliable value. Take them when they align with actions you'll take regardless of your overall strategy.

A card like Forest Clearer is a great early pick because it's powerful without needing a "Forest Clearer strategy." A card like Loam Pit is a poor pick unless you're already committed to Day Laborer.

### Strategy Archetypes (Tag-Based)

The 12 strategy tags represent loose clusters of synergistic cards. These aren't rigid archetypes — most winning drafts blend elements of 2-3 tags. But understanding them helps you recognize when a strategy is forming.

**Space-value strategies (Type 1 — making underused spaces powerful):**

- **Day Laborer (18 cards):** The purest Type 1 strategy. The Day Laborer space (2 food baseline) is one of the weakest actions in the game. But Job Contract (Rank 4) combines Day Laborer + Lessons into one action. Hardware Store (Rank 16) adds a full resource suite for 2 food. Assistant Tiller (Rank 26) adds a free plow. Seasonal Worker and Stew pile on food and resources. With 3+ DL cards in play, a single Day Laborer action becomes worth 3-4 normal actions on a space nobody else wants. **Critical mass needed:** 2-3 strong DL cards. Without them, the space isn't worth visiting.

- **Fishing (26 cards):** Brewery Pond (Rank 9) is the anchor — adding grain + wood to each fishing trip. The Fishing space already accumulates food, so it has a higher baseline than Day Laborer. But without support cards it's still just a food source. With Brewery Pond + Supply Boat + other fishing cards, every fishing trip becomes a resource-generating event. **Lower critical mass than DL:** Even Brewery Pond alone makes the space significantly better.

- **Traveling Players (14 cards):** Small but potent cluster. House Artist (Rank 27) is the standout, combining TP with free room-building — a single action that gets food AND builds your house. Market Master adds occupation plays. The TP space accumulates food like Fishing, so the base is decent. **Very high ceiling, low floor:** Without House Artist or Market Master, the other TP cards are marginal.

- **Grain (23 cards):** Cards tied to the Grain Seeds action space. Field Watchman (Rank 44, ADP 1.13 — the first card drafted on average) adds a free plow. Private Teacher adds occupation plays. The Grain Seeds space is used more than DL/TP but less than wood/clay, so there's room to make it a strategic anchor. Often overlaps with Sow strategies.

- **Sow (30 cards):** Cards that generate resources or actions from sowing, primarily centered on the Grain Utilization space (and more rarely Cultivation). Slurry gives free sow actions at harvest. Cow Patty adds bonus crops when sowing adjacent to pastures. Apiary lets you sow every round. The grain/vegetable points are a nice side benefit, but the real value is making an underused space into a multi-action hub — classic Type 1.

- **Major/Minor (39 cards):** Cards that reward building improvements. Task Artisan, Young Farmer, Wood Workshop. The Major/Minor Improvement space is used by all players occasionally, but this cluster turns it into a strategic hub — every improvement play generates extra resources or actions.

- **Lesson (39 cards):** Somewhat hybrid. Cards that reward playing many occupations — Bookcase gives a vegetable per occupation, Bookshelf gives 3 food before each play, Education Bonus escalates rewards. The Lessons action space is where you play occupations, and normally it's just a cost (spend food to play a card). Lesson strategies flip this: the act of playing occupations itself generates value. Also a Type 2 strategy since playing more occupations generates more side-effect actions. Synergizes naturally with Day Laborer (Job Contract is tagged both).

**Action-generating strategies (Type 2 — more output per round):**

- **Big House (31 cards):** The primary growth-enabling archetype. Furnisher (Rank 18) gives wood and lets you play improvements after each room. Wooden Hut Extender (Rank 42) reduces room cost dramatically. Recreational Carpenter gives free Build Rooms actions. Big House strategies build rooms cheaply and quickly, creating room for children (growth) and scoring through room points (especially stone rooms at 2pt each). Also a partial Type 1 strategy when combined with Traveling Players (House Artist).

- **Small House (7 cards):** The radical alternative to Big House. Field Doctor (Rank 41) is the key card — enabling family growth without building a single room, if surrounded by 4 fields. You sacrifice room points but gain massive action efficiency: no actions spent building rooms, no resources spent on rooms, and you can grow earlier. **Very high-risk:** The cluster is tiny (7 cards), so you can't build a full strategy around it. Field Doctor is more of a complementary pick that changes your growth plan than a drafting archetype.

- **Stone House (31 cards):** Cards that reward rushing renovation to stone with a small house. The core logic: you renovate early with fewer rooms (cheaper), then use stone house-conditional cards to generate the actions you'd otherwise get from having more rooms. Scholar (Rank 369, but powerful in context) plays an occupation or minor every round once in stone. Plow Driver (Rank 82) plows a field every round — a pure generated action replacing a worker placement. These cards recover the action deficit of a small house through ongoing side effects. Note: Skillful Renovator (Rank 17) is technically tagged Stone House but plays better as a complementary card in Big House strategies — with many rooms, the wood payout from renovation is enormous. True Stone House strategy is about few rooms, early reno, and action generation.

- **Stable (36 cards):** Cards that reward building stables. Sample Stable Maker (Rank 86) is arguably the core card — it lets you return built stables for resources and actions, and crucially lets you build more than 4 stables total (since returned stables can be rebuilt), which means triggers like Shed Builder's grain/food rewards can be activated repeatedly. Beer Stall converts empty unfenced stables into a food engine. Stallwright gives free stables after occupations. Stable strategies generate value through side effects — stables that you might build anyway for animal housing become an action and resource engine. Often hybrid with Animal strategies since stables double pasture capacity.

- **Animal (71 cards, largest cluster):** The broadest archetype, spanning both advantage types. Food engines (Milking Stool, Loom) are Type 2 — they generate food passively from animals you're already keeping. Scoring cards (Cow Prince, Full Farmer) push point ceiling. Enabling cards (Pet Lover, Animal Husbandry Worker) reduce the action cost of animal acquisition. Animal strategies tend to be robust because animals serve triple duty: food, scoring, and farmyard coverage. The risk is action-intensity — fencing, acquiring animals, and managing pastures takes many actions upfront before the engine pays off.

### Synergy Over Raw Power

Synergy matters because **you can't draft 14 elite cards.** You're drafting 7 occupations and 7 minor improvements, and the best cards get snapped up by opponents. By round 7, you're picking from cards ranked in the 300s if you're lucky. The only way to get high value from mid-ranked cards is to draft them into a coherent engine where they amplify each other.

This follows directly from the investment model. Each card you play costs an action (and often food). If your cards all amplify the same action space or game plan, those setup actions pay off every round for the rest of the game. If your cards point in different directions, you've spent 3-4 actions on setup that each only pays off occasionally. A mid-ranked card that perfectly fits your engine is worth far more than a higher-ranked card that doesn't connect to anything.

That said, synergy doesn't mean you should pass up elite cards for weaker ones that happen to share a tag. Given the choice between Lover + Brewery Pond + Furnisher (three elite cards in different directions) and Brewery Pond + Supply Boat + Rod Collection (a tight fishing engine with two mediocre cards), skilled players take the former every time. Elite cards are elite because they're powerful enough to justify the action of playing them in almost any context. **Synergy is how you maximize value from the rest of your 14 cards — the ones that aren't individually dominant.**

The exception: **complementary cards that enhance actions you'd take in any strategy.** Forest Clearer makes wood better for everyone. Cultivator makes plowing better for everyone. These don't need a dedicated strategy because the actions they enhance are universal. You can pair Forest Clearer with a Day Laborer engine and it doesn't pull your strategy apart — it just makes your wood trips better on the side.

The draft is about building a machine, not collecting trophies — but elite parts are still worth taking when they're available.

### When to Deviate: Hate Drafting and Flexibility

**Hate drafting** — taking a card specifically to deny an opponent — is occasionally correct but usually wrong. You're giving up a card that helps you to deny one that helps them. It's worth it when:
- The card is the missing piece that makes an opponent's draft dominant
- Your alternative pick is weak anyway (late rounds)
- You've already locked your strategy and the marginal value of your best pick is low

**Staying flexible** in rounds 1-2 is generally good advice, but remember that you're drafting an occupation *and* a minor simultaneously each round. This means strong synergies can land in your lap immediately. If your round 1 hands contain Assistant Tiller (occ) and Stew (minor), that's a Day Laborer engine starter handed to you for free — and the power of synergies on underused spaces often feels exponential. In that case, taking the synergistic pair over generically stronger but unrelated cards is usually correct. Flexibility matters more when your two hands don't naturally align.

### The Play Rate Signal

Cards with very high play rates (>85%) are reliably useful regardless of what else you draft. Cards with lower play rates (<50%) are powerful in the right context but dead weight otherwise. During the draft:
- If your strategy is already strong, you can afford to take a high-ceiling / low-play-rate card
- If your strategy has gaps, take the reliable high-play-rate card that shores up a weakness

### Key Principles Summary

1. **Plan food for the late game.** Early harvests are easy. The real test is rounds 9-14, when harvests come every 2 rounds and your family is bigger. Draft a food plan that scales, not one that solves round 4.
2. **Actions are the currency.** Growth, generated actions, and card-enhanced spaces all serve the same goal: getting more done per round than your opponents.
3. **Value per cost, not just power.** The best cards reward you for playing well; the worst force you into suboptimal lines. Always ask what a card costs you — explicitly and implicitly.
4. **Build a machine, not a collection.** Synergy across your 14 cards beats 14 disconnected power picks.
5. **Read what's disappearing.** Opponent signals inform what action spaces will be contested and what strategies to avoid doubling up on.
6. **Fill the gap.** After rounds 1-2, always ask: "What does my draft need most?" Take that, not the generically best card.
7. **Board baseline is non-negotiable.** Avoid -1 penalties in any category. The 5-point swing from -1 to +4 is huge, but the 2-point swing from -1 to +1 is the most efficient.
8. **Point ceiling helps but doesn't have to be huge.** Some bonus scoring gives you an edge. You can win with a clean vanilla farm, but card-based points make it easier.
9. **Respect flip order risk.** Strategies that work regardless of when specific round cards appear are safer.
